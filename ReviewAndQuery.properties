Review = You want real New York/New Jersey style pizza in the East Bay?The only place able to deliver the real deal is Arinel Pizza in Berkeley. It is a hole in the wall, and it is not the real Rays on 7th in Manhattan (also a hole in the wall), but it is solid, good quality east coast pizza, honestly. After living in CA for 29 years, coming from New Jersey, this is the only pizza that reminds me of the halcyon days of my youth.
