Review = This is my favorite pizza spot in SF! Went here with the Mr. and we enjoyed the delicious garlic bread, a Caprese Salad (the cheese, tomatoes and basil were AMAZING with that balsamic), and Mediterranean Chicken Deep Dish Pizza. Usually with a pizza I feel the ingredients are not in balance with each other, this was not the case at Little Star.  Even the Fetta did not offend and was delicious atop the pizza! This place has a great atmosphere, nice lighting, and good beer to accompany the cheesy morsel of your choice! We will be returning to Little Star!
